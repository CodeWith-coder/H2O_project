- Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the backend folder for environment-specific configurations such as database URIs, secret keys, and ports.
- Simultaneous Servers: The backend and frontend servers should run concurrently for the project to function fully.

- Icon resources: FONT AWESOME, the resource for icons and symbols can be usd in web and app development. https://fontawesome.com/search 


### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues with dependencies, ensure that Node.js and npm are installed correctly.
- Check MongoDB connection settings if the backend cannot connect to the database.
